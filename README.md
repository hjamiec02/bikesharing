## Overview of the statistical analysis:

For this analysis, I began by using data provided by Citi Bike for New York City Rentals during the month of August 2019. I uploaded the data into Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I created a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
- Finally, I added these new visualizations to others that I previously created in this module for my final presentation and analysis, as shown in my Tableau story.

## Results:

Below is a picture and description of each visualization I created for this analysis:

- In this visualization, I created a heatmap that shows the number of bike trips broken down by gender for each day of the week by each Usertype.


## Summary:

This module was attempting to answer a question as to whether a to open bike rental company in Des Moines, Iowa using data from New York City's Citi Bike Rental.  After the completion of the module, I believe that there is not enough information to make a decision as to if a similar business would work in Des Moines.  While the Citi Bike data was useful in displaying rental frequency and peak periods, I believe we need more information on the city of Des Moines in comparison to New York City. 

Future analysis could compare peak tourism periods between Des Moines and New York City in a line graph over the 12 months of a particular year.  This analysis would also help to determine how many bikes would be necessary for initial purchase for Des Moines.  Another visualization could be created displaying the most popular outdoor recreational activities between the two Cities, to help determine if bike riding is as popular in Des Moines as it is in New York City.
